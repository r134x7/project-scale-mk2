## Project Scale Mk2

  

  # Description
  
  This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.    

  This project, i.e., Project Scale Mk2 is a successor to Project Scale. The change in tech stack from MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React JS, Node.js + GraphQL for API) to the T3 Stack (TypeScript, React JS, Next.js, Prisma ORM, NextAuth, Tailwind CSS, tRPC) greatly takes advantage of typesafety to reduce bugs and runtime errors.

  The project is deployed on Vercel and uses MySQL for the database.   

  The app itself is about self-improvement, and the MVP of the project allows you to create ambitions to progress to a goal. You can make a record each day and have your records visualised on a line chart.

  One of the major changes from the original Project Scale is increasing social engagement by allowing you to create bonds with others that you know so that you and the other people you bond with can grow together from the ambitions you are trying to achieve.
